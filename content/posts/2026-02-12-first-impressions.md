### Scope

Browsed around the https://curl.se/docs/ and gaping at the vastness of the tool's architecture



### Key Observations

- Be consistent, and spend atleast 15-20min each day, in exploring the portal

- Ask yourself, what can I do, to contribute? It may be too early, but having the question at the back of your mind would be useful


### Questions

- Identify areas, where you want to deep-dive and list your questions here.


### Areas to focus on

- Read the documentation available (be selective, don't just rush through the content)

- Ask yourself, what an I trying to learn and how can I apply this concept.
