### Interesting Insight

Came across an interesting insight on the Risky.Biz podcast. 

The absence of change in network traffic patterns, could be attributable to an underlying event. 

### Lesson learnt 

Absence of indicators, may imply something more than the obvious.

Think second order effects. 
In the example discussed in the podcast (Episode #824), this was mentioned in the GreyNoise newsletter,  which noted a total drop in telnet traffic. 

Apparently, a vulnerability in the telnet protocol is likely to drop soon. And the service providers have probably been nudged into blocking all Telnet traffic.
