## Interesting Insight

Came across an interesting insight on the Risky.Biz podcast. 

The absence of change in network traffic patterns, could be attributable to an underlying event. 

In the example discussed in the podcast (Episode #824), this was mentioned in the GreyNoise newsletter,  which noted a total drop in telnet traffic. 

Apparently, a vulnerability in the telnet protocol is likely to drop soon. And the service providers have probably been nudged into blocking all Telnet traffic.
